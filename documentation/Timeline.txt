1. Implement multi-stock data processing:
Modify data modules to handle multiple tickers
Create function to fetch and preprocess data for given list of tickers
Update data splitting logic for multiple stocks

Optimize model architecture and training:
Fine-tune existing LSTM architecture for faster iteration
Experiment with layer configurations and regularization
Implement early stopping and model checkpointing

Parallelize backtesting and evaluation:
Refactor backtesting engine for parallel processing of multiple stocks
Use multiprocessing library to distribute workload
Aggregate performance metrics across all stocks

Implement adaptive trading rules:
Introduce dynamic thresholds based on market volatility
Use ATR-based position sizing and stop-loss/take-profit levels
Adjust trading logic for multiple stocks

Enhance logging and error handling:
Add comprehensive logging statements to track progress and issues
Implement error handling and exception catching
Log performance metrics and trading decisions for each stock

Proposed timeline:
Next 2 hours: Multi-stock data processing and LSTM optimization
Following 2 hours: Parallelized backtesting and adaptive trading rules
Final 2 hours: Enhanced logging, testing, and performance reporting
