# Trading Bot Architecture

## Overview
This trading bot is a sophisticated machine learning-based system designed to analyze financial market data and execute trades based on a hybrid approach combining LSTM predictions with technical analysis. The system uses an enhanced LSTM neural network with attention mechanisms and residual connections for improved prediction accuracy.
