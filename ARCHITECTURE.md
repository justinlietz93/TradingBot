# Trading Bot Architecture

## Overview
This trading bot is a machine learning-based system designed to analyze financial market data and execute trades based on predictive models. The system uses LSTM neural networks to predict both price movements and trading signals.

## Core Components

### 1. Data Layer (`data/`)
- **DataLoader**: Handles data acquisition and preprocessing
  - Fetches historical data from Yahoo Finance
  - Calculates technical indicators
  - Performs feature scaling and normalization
  - Creates sequences for LSTM input
- **DataSplitter**: Manages train/validation/test splits

### 2. Model Layer (`models/`)
- **MLModel**: LSTM-based neural network
  - Multi-head attention mechanism
  - Residual connections
  - Layer normalization
  - Dropout for regularization
  - Custom loss functions and metrics

### 3. Strategy Layer (`strategies/`)
- **MLTradingStrategy**: Implements trading logic
  - Signal generation from model predictions
  - Position sizing and risk management
  - Trade execution rules

### 4. Configuration (`config/`)
- **Config**: Centralizes all parameters
  - Data parameters (tickers, dates)
  - Model hyperparameters
  - Trading parameters
  - Logging settings

### 5. Utilities (`utils/`)
- Logging utilities
- Performance metrics
- Data visualization tools

### 6. Testing (`tests/`)
- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- Backtesting framework

### 7. Environment (`trading_env/`)
- Custom trading environment
- State management
- Action space definition
- Reward calculation
